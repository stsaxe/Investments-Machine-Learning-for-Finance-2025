# Investments-Machine-Learning-for-Finance-2025


This is the repository for the group project of Alexander Jean-Marc Fuchser, Daniel Eymann 
and Stefan Richard Saxer created for the course "Investments â€“ Selected Quantitative Tools" at UZH in spring 2025.

This repository is structured as follows:
- **data**: contains the provided dataset converted from XLSX to CSV
- **data_loading**: helper functions for loading and splitting the dataset and a custom PyTorch dataset class for time series regression, the TimeSeriesDataSet
- **feature_search**: the implementation of the heuristic feature selection algorithm based on greedy best-first search
- **modeling**: helper classes for training of models and inference
- **models**: contains the custom PyTorch implementations of an MLP, a CNN, an LSTM and a Transformer (not used in the paper)
- **notebooks**: various Jupyter notebooks that generate the main artifacts of this project 
  - *data_analysis*: basic data analysis and exploration of the provided dataset
  - *feature_selection*: implementation and execution of the feature selection algorithm 
  - *feature_selection_analysis*: analysis of the various runs of the feature selection algorithm 
  - *modeling*: training and inference of the various pytorch models 
  - *modeling_analysis*: evaluation of the training and inference 
- **output**: all the outputs generated by the Jupyter notebooks. This includes plots, tables and the trained PyTorch models.
- **tests**: some rudimentary unit tests for the most important components
- **utils**: utility functions, mostly used for plotting
- **configuration.py**: a configuration file that defines global variables for the project

Please note that this project requires at least Python Version **3.11** or later for execution.
